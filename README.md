With thirty articles from biology, machine learning, and psychology at hand, our goal is to be able to classify sentences into five classes:

- Aim (AIMX): the specific research goal of the paper
- Own (OWNX): the author's own work, e.g. methods, results, conclusions
- Contrast (CONT): contrast, comparison or critique of past work
- Basis (BASE): past work that provides the basis for the work in the article
- Misc (MISC): any other sentences

The data set comes from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentence+Classification .
